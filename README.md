## About Me

Hello, I am a full-stack developer with expertise in JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, React, and Redux. I am keen on Python and C/C++ and enjoy experimenting with new technologies. I am an avid chess player and Linux enthusiast in my free time. I use Linux as my primary operating system and like to tinker with it as a hobby. I am open to new opportunities and am excited to continue building my skills and working on new projects. Let's do something great together!
